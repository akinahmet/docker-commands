## Basic Docker Commands

### Docker Container Commands

```

Run a command in a new container

```text
docker run [IMAGE] [COMMAND]
```

```text
docker run --rm [IMAGE] # removes a container after it exits.

docker run -td [IMAGE] # starts a container and keeps it running.

docker run -it [IMAGE] # starts a container, allocates a pseudo-TTY connected to the containerâ€™s stdin, and creates an interactive bash shell in the container.

docker run -it-rm [IMAGE] # creates, starts, and runs a command inside the container. Once it executes the command, the container is removed.
```
